'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of 
all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is 
a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
'''

num_to_div = int(input("Enter number to divide: "))
zero_remain = []
for divisors in range(num_to_div):
    if divisors > 0:
        check_div = num_to_div % divisors
        if check_div == 0:
            zero_remain.append(divisors)
print(zero_remain)
